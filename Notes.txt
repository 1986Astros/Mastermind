Hints on how to build a computer player: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind

CURRENT BUGS:
* If PlayerControl is set to AI it can't be changed to a human player. Could put the players in order on the menu AI first if AI current, humans first if human selected
- Not tested: More than one human.
- Fix the Start and game flow button appearance.
- Line up the PlayerControls with the bottom of the pegBoard1.

BUGS:
* Pegs on the PegBoard can be dropped on the Cradle, changing the color. The Cradle and its pegs should not AllowDrop in this case.

RECORDS - json?
* Each possible puzzle - keep its records, just how many times and total turns.
* Each player - all solo scores

Variations:
* Solo - best score 1, 2 or more consecutive games in a sitting; best time 1 game
* Humans (2+) same puzzles
* Humans (2+) different puzzles
* Human vs. computer
* 6 colors, 4 pegs per row, 10 turns, 30 or 100 points
* 8 colors, 5 pegs per row, 12 turns, 30 or 100 points
* Any variation, but no records kept, so the game can be set up for children

PegBoard:
* Line up the results pegs horizontally (as an option?)
* Scoring indicator - but instead of pegs a progress bar.
* Specify the location for the next peg to land.
* Remove peg.
* On the current row use the Peg control instead of drawing played pegs, so the peg can be moved and double-clicked and DELeted
* Drag and drop
** Drop target - drag to self to move pegs on board
** Drag off board to remove

Cradle:
* Drag and drop: Pegs can be rearranged.

Peg:
* Accept Enter or Space for selection.
* Drag and drop
** Drag off board to play
** Drop target for removing pegs

Future:
* Notes- let the player take notes by placing pegs in a sandbox, scribble words
