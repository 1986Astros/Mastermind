CURRENT BUGS:
- The tlp inside the OuterPane needs to resize itself to account for scrollbars.
- Requires a mouse.

BUGS:
* Pegs on the PegBoard cannot be dropped on the Cradle (correct behavior), but the drag/drop feedback says they will drop (which is incorrect feedback).

Variations:
* Solo - best score 1, 2 or more consecutive games in a sitting; best time 1 game
* Humans (2+) same puzzles
* Humans (2+) different puzzles
* Human vs. computer
* 6 colors, 4 pegs per row, 10 turns, 30 or 100 points
* 8 colors, 5 pegs per row, 12 turns, 30 or 100 points
* Any variation, but no records kept, so the game can be set up for children

Future:
* Notes- let the player take notes by placing pegs in a sandbox, scribble words
